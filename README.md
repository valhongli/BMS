Exploiting surroundedness for saliency detection: a boolean map approach

This is the code for paper:" Exploiting surroundedness for saliency detection: a {B}oolean map approach"
Project website:
http://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/BMS/BMS.html

I am not the one who write these codes. I only put them together in visual studio and compile them. I also write some files to show how to use them.

In folder EXE, you can directly run the program to get the eye fixation results. The simple way is to double click run.bat. If you run under command line, the parameters are listed in usage.txt file.

In folder VisualStudio, the entire solution is presented. By opening BMS.sln, you can get the solution run.

In folder MatlabWrapper, run demo.m to get the results saved in folder output.

I use OpenCV 2.4.9.
